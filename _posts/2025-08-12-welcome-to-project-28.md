I started this movement after my father took his own life in 2025. He did not suffer from mental illness, he did not suffer from alcholism, he was not abused or abusive, he was simply alone and had that one day. That one, bad day.

No man, no boy, aged 16 or 60, should ever feel like they do not have someone to turn to, and someone they can rely on for support. But in this day and age, with the explosion of the internet, empowered feminism, and our neglected boys and young men, increasingly we have been left behind. Men account for around 4 times higher suicide rates than women in America. Despite that, men seek mental health treatment 10% less than women. Men double the drug usage rates and will die from overdoses at those same rates.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I know first hand what you are going through. What we are going through. And god damnit, together we are going to make this right.

How? Well that's the hard part, isn't it. 
I've got a 3 act structure to help anyone. We focus on the physical, the mental, and the how to's. 

Physical? That's the easy one. Get 8 hours of sleep. Eat healthy. Go to the gym. Have sex.

Mental? That's a little tougher. How to recognize when you need a break. How to manage stress. How to get through to your fellow brother who's begging to be helped but can't get out of his own way.

And the How to's. This is what got me through 90% of my life. I didn't know how to do a damn thing growing up, without the internet I'd be a loser. But I learned how to do things myself, step by step, with experienced internet guides. And if nothing else, I can do that for you. How to change a tire. How to tie a tie. How to cook a steak. How to tell a woman you love them. 

I don't know everything. Nobody does. I know a few things, and I hope they'll help you. And maybe you'll be able to share a few things, and that'll help a few others. And so on. We will chat, call, text, group text, whatever you're feeling that day. And I promise you, I will never stop giving everything I have to build us a better future.
