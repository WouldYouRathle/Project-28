This is the first month of Project 28. I haven't been able to make any real headway in the project, largely due to the fact I have no clue what I'm doing and how to achieve these goals. That said, I reached out to the (remaining) men I know, and hope to poll them for opinions, perspectives, and questions. Beyond that, making the website a bit nicer would be this month's goal, and potentially uploading a few How-To's seems like a solid target to work towards.
Other than that, I've been feeling a bit blue lately, so I'm going to pen a letter to my Dad. Readers, you don't have to be a part of this, feel free to click away.

Hey Dad,
It's been a few months now since you left this world. I still have your picture up on my desk, and I still look at it every day. Some days I'm still mad at you. Some days I forgive you. Every day I miss you. Mostly, I'm just trying to navigate this emotional ocean. I think Aubrey Plaza summed it up well, talking about death after her husband took his own life.
"At all times, there's like a giant ocean of just awfulness that's right there."
Yea. She's right. Grief is this vast, endless pain. It's all consuming, and all powerful. It comes in waves though, and that's good. Some days we almost forget the waves are there, they'll just splash our feet, little 3 inch tall waves. A glance at a photo. A flash of a memory. Other days, those waves are still just as big as ever, 100 feet tall and crashing into us and knocking us to the ground. 
I bawled like a kid watching the guy in "A Star is Born" take his life. I nearly broke down remembering that I saved the voicemails you left me years ago. I got caught up seeing you in my phone saved as 'Dad', despite the fact that it's not even your number anymore. Heck, it might even be someone else's phone number now. Life goes on. 

I really hope we can make something out of this movement. I called my cousin and asked her to perform a simple task for me yesterday-just check in on the men in her life. Dad, Brother, whatever. Just say hi, and see if they're doing okay. She laughed. That's why I started this movement. That laughter. That dismissiveness. That's what the fight is against, not men's rights versus women's rights, equality, abortion, all that fucking drama that people try to exploit to pit us against each other in some societal gender war. No, I just want people to start caring about each other. 

Anyway, I hope you're doing well, wherever you are. I'm not a spiritual man, so I can't say whether or not you end up in Heaven or Hell, 72 virgins or just turn into space dust. But hopefully, wherever you are, whatever you are now, you found peace.
I love you Dad.
